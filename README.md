* B) Create a .yaml file, put your start url in there and refer this file via `go-aws-sso -c my-config-file.yaml`
  * ```start-url: https://my-sso-login.awsapps.com``` 
* C) Create a file `~/.aws/go-aws-sso-config.yaml` and put the start-url in there
* Choose the account you want the roles to be displayed
* Choose a role
    * in case there is only one role available this role is taken as default
* Short living credentials are written to `~/.aws/credentials`
